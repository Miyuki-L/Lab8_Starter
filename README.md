# Lab 8 - Starter

1. If we can only chose one of the given options and specific to this project I would manually run the test locally before pushing the code as it will make the development and testing process a bit easier because I do not have to always be pushing the code to the repo to run the test as I would be pushing potentially buggy code to he repo. If there is an option I would implement both running test locally before pushing and using Github action when code is pushed so that I could limited the pushing of potentially buggy code and also make sure that the code works not only on my local machine. 
2. I wouldn't use end to end testing to check if a function is returning the correct output that feels more like a unit testing thing as we know what we want the output to be. End to End testing seems more of testing the behavior of the app if it behaves and response to action in the way you expect it to response, which may or maynot have a "output" you could check against.
